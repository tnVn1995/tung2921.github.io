<h1>About Me<br /></h1>
    </header>
    <p>Hello, my name is Tung Nguyen. I'm from Vietnam. Currently, I'm pursuing my master degree in Statistics at Texas Tech Univeristy. 
        I love using data to solve challenging problems. My main interest is computer vision and the use of cv in autonomous tasks such as self-driving cars.
        I'm also interested in Natural Language Processing and traditional machine learning methods. Don't hesitate to contact me if you would like for questions or any
        potential collaborations.
    </p>
